 <h1>FAQ's</h1>
	<p><strong>Q) What are we doing about Covid-19 and food safety?</strong></p>
<p>A) We are taking every precaution to ensure the safe handling, preparation and delivery of our celebration cakes. We are adhering to these best practices: </p>
<ol>
<li>Hand washing after entering the shop and regularly throughout the day</li>
<li>Wearing clean chefs coat and apron, with hair tied back</li>
<li>Wearing face visor and face mask when processing and handling any food products</li>
<li>Wearing gloves when serving customers and, where appropriate, handling food</li>
<li>Frequent cleaning of the shop and high-touch points</li>
<li>Avoiding close contact with other staff as well as customers. We have installed Perspex<span> </span>screens for added protection.</li>
<li>Training staff on new practices and updates from the government food standards agency</li>
</ol>
<p>We will encourage our customers to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Sanitize their hands at our sanitizer stations on entering the shop</li>
<li>Keep 2 metres apart from others</li>
<li>Use contactless payment if possible </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Q) Where are your shops located?<br></strong>A) Our bakery is based on Bywell Road, Dewsbury, WF12 7JT<br><br>
<strong>Q) The cake I want isn’t on your website, what can I do?</strong><br>A) No problem! Contact Bywell Bakers via our <a href="contactme.html">contact us page.</a><br>
<br><strong>Q) How long do I need to order in advance?</strong><br>A) Our beautiful cakes are hand-crafted. Many can be made within a week, however, our most intricate designs can take up to 14 days (plus delivery). ‘Quick cakes’ can be delivered within one week. If you’re in a hurry and need a cake today, we do have cakes ready for quick customisation so please pop into our Bywell Road shop and we’ll be able to create something for you to take away.<br> 
<br><strong>Q) What size cake do I need?</strong><br>A) We always advise the right size cake to feed the number of people attending your event or party. However some cakes, especially the novelty-shaped cakes, are only available in one size due to the shape and style of the design. Wherever we mention portions we are basing this on a slice size approximately 6cm by 3.5cm by 1.5cm.<br>
<br>Delivery &amp; Storage<br><strong>Q) Do you deliver?</strong><br>A) Yes, please visit our <a href="contactme.html">contact us page.</a> to discuss your needs.<br>
<br><strong>Q) How long do your cakes last?</strong><br>A) The chocolate, vanilla sponge, red velvet and carrot cakes should last 5 days if they are stored at room temperature in a cool place. Once cut the cake should be kept airtight to retain the freshness. Our fruit cakes should last at least three months. Do not put any of our cakes in the fridge, as this will affect the quality. It is possible to freeze leftover cake, however, please be aware that the icing will be impaired.<br>
<br><strong>Q) Can you keep marzipan models from the cake?</strong><br>A) These need to be eaten within 3 months. Some of our customers have loved the models so much, they have decided to retain these as keepsakes. In this case, it is recommended that you air-dry them for 3 months. Good results have been achieved by varnishing them with everyday varnish.<br>
<br>ALLERGY ADVICE<br><strong>Q) What about allergy information?</strong><br>A) All our cake ingredients are available on request</p>
